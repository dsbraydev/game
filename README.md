Hello and welcome!

In this assesment you'll be asked to make a tiny game, all of which will be explained once you get the solution running on your computer.

Pre-requisites:
VS Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/)
NodeJs & NPM (https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/current)

How to get started:
Open the "Game" folder in VS code
Click on "Terminal" -> "New Terminal"
Run "npm install" in the terminal
If that completes successfully run "npm run buildlocaldev" in the terminal
The "game" should open in a browser, now you can follow the on screen instructions
